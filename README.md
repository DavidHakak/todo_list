# To-Do List with Redux

This is a simple web application for managing to-do lists, built with React and Redux. You can create new lists, add new tasks to them, mark tasks as completed, delete lists or completed tasks, and search for lists by name. The application also supports a day and night mode.

## Getting Started

To run the application locally, you need to have Node.js installed. Then, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the dependencies by running `npm install` or `yarn install`.
3. Run the application by running `npm start` or `yarn start`.
4. The application should open automatically in your default browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

To create a new list, click on the "Add List" button and enter a name for the list. To add a new task to a list, click on the list name and enter a task description. To mark a task as completed, click on the checkbox next to it. To delete a list or a completed task, click on the trash icon next to it. To search for a list by name, type the search term in the input field above the lists. To delete all the lists, click on the "Delete All" button. To switch between day and night mode, click on the sun or moon icon in the top right corner.

## Technologies Used

* React
* Redux
* JavaScript
* CSS

## Future Improvements

Currently, the application only uses local storage to store the data. In the future, it could be connected to a server-side API to support data persistence and collaboration.

## Acknowledgments

This project was inspired by Google Keep and was built as a learning exercise for React and Redux.
