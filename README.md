# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# To-Do List with Redux

This is a simple web application for managing to-do lists, built with React and Redux. You can create new lists, add new tasks to them, mark tasks as completed, delete lists or completed tasks, and search for lists by name. The application also supports a day and night mode.

## Getting Started

To run the application locally, you need to have Node.js installed. Then, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the dependencies by running `npm install` or `yarn install`.
3. Run the application by running `npm start` or `yarn start`.
4. The application should open automatically in your default browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

To create a new list, click on the "Add List" button and enter a name for the list. To add a new task to a list, click on the list name and enter a task description. To mark a task as completed, click on the checkbox next to it. To delete a list or a completed task, click on the trash icon next to it. To search for a list by name, type the search term in the input field above the lists. To delete all the lists, click on the "Delete All" button. To switch between day and night mode, click on the sun or moon icon in the top right corner.

## Technologies Used

* React
* Redux
* JavaScript
* CSS

## Future Improvements

Currently, the application only uses local storage to store the data. In the future, it could be connected to a server-side API to support data persistence and collaboration.

## Acknowledgments

This project was inspired by Google Keep and was built as a learning exercise for React and Redux.
